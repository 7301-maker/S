1. A school maintains a list of student names who have registered for an event. Given a student’s name, implement sequential search to check if they have registered.



#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    string students[50];
    string key;
    bool found = false;

    cout << "Enter number of registered students: ";
    cin >> n;

    cout << "Enter student names:\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> students[i];
    }

    cout << "Enter student name to search: ";
    cin >> key;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (students[i] == key) {
            cout << "Student is registered at position " << i;
            found = true;
            break;
        }
    }

    if (!found) {
        cout << "Student is NOT registered";
    }

    return 0;
}
